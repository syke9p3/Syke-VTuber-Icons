## Spring Boot
Spring Boot: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot

This logo is based on **Spring** and **Spring Boot**. Here I replace the two letter *o*'s with the Spring and Spring Boot logo. I also had to put The ```@SpringBootApplication``` annotation as well because that's the start of every Spring Boot projects
